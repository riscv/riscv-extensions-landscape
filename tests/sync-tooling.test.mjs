/**
 * The synchronisation tooling, exercised as processes.
 *
 * These scripts had no tests, which is uncomfortable given how much rides on
 * them: they decide which upstream instructions attach to which extension, and
 * a silent misroute there shows up much later as a catalogue that looks fine
 * and is wrong. Two real examples reached production — RV128I displaying
 * RV64I's 52 instructions because it was routed through the rv64_i tag, and
 * MRET/WFI reachable from nowhere because no catalogue entry claimed them.
 *
 * They export nothing and run on load, so they are driven the way CI drives
 * them rather than imported. That is the honest surface: it tests the thing
 * that actually runs.
 *
 * Nothing here writes. The instruction sync is exercised through --dry-run, and
 * one test asserts --dry-run really does leave the catalogue alone — a guard on
 * the guard, since every other test in this file depends on it.
