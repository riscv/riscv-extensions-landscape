/**
 * The opcode map arithmetic.
 *
 * Worth pinning because the width rule is easy to get wrong in a way that still
 * looks plausible. The first version classified an instruction as compressed
 * when its mask fitted in 16 bits, which sounds reasonable until you notice an
 * I-type mask of 0x707f is numerically below 0xffff. That filed ordinary 32-bit
 * instructions into quadrant 3, which does not exist, and the totals still
 * looked believable.
