/**
 * Reference links point at the extension, not at a repository root.
 *
 * Every catalog entry used to carry the same URL — github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual
 * — so "open reference link" told you nothing about the extension you clicked.
 * scripts/map-doc-links.mjs now resolves each one to its chapter on
 * docs.riscv.org.
 *
 * These tests do not reach the network. They guard the shape of the result and,
 * more importantly, the mistakes the mapping is prone to: a wrong link is worse
 * than the generic one it replaced, because it looks right.
