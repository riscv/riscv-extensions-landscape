/**
 * Our dependency model, checked against riscv-config — RISC-V International's
 * own validator (riscv/riscv-config, isa_validator.py, v3.18.3).
 *
 * A third opinion, independent of riscv-unified-db and of clang. All 32 of our
 * canonical -march strings were accepted by it, and 9 of its rules were already
 * encoded here. The rules below are transcribed from that file so a future
 * change that contradicts the official validator fails in CI.
 *
 * The rules are transcribed rather than executed. riscv-config is Python, knows
 * 74 sub-extensions against our 227 (so it skips every profile), spells strings
 * differently from -march, and crashes on valid input — get_extension_list
 * ("RV64IZicsr_Zk") raises IndexError, because it reads the third character of
 * a two-character extension name. Shelling out to it would add a dependency, a
 * translation layer, and a silent-skip problem, for rules that fit in a table.
 *
 * Three of its rules are deliberately NOT asserted; see EXCLUDED below.
